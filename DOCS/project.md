# Project Overview
In this file we will talk about the steps and stages of project construction. The steps available to complete the project, the project vision, the steps and all the issues about project management.
This project proceeds with the Waterfall methodology, in such a way that each step must be done first before we can move on to the next step. In the project path, changes must reach zero. All the things we need must first be thought about, then analyzed and finally implemented. During the project path, nothing outside the plan should be added to the tasks.
The map and the route must be completely clear and precise.

# Vision
In general, this website is an online shopping store where people can view and buy products. Shopping is done online using payment gateways. Each user can also upload their products to this website for sale.
The [implementation](https://github.com/AryaFardmanesh/TakShop/blob/main/DOCS/implementation.md) document lists all the pages required for this website.
In general, the following features should be present on this website:
- Login/Register
- Buy Product
- Upload Product
- Shopping Portal
- Admin Panel
- Sales Panel

# Steps
To implement and build this platform, we need to have specific steps. These steps must be done in order, correctly, and systematically so that we can move on to the next stages of the project. I will explain these steps below.

## 1. Database Structure
In the first step, the database structure must be created and saved in an SQL file.

## 2. Project Base
At this stage, the foundations of the project should be established, such as the project build system and the project file system, so that code can be easily written and outputted.

## 3. Server Base Code
At this stage, the basic server code must be implemented, such as the server's primary functions, internal classes, database communication methods, etc.

## 4. UI/UX Design
At this stage, UI/UX design should be done in Figma and all visual implementation of the website should be designed.

## 5. Front-End
In this step, we will implement the Front-End of the website, or the client. This client should be consistent with the UI/UX that has been designed beforehand.

## 6. Back-End
In this phase, the Back-End is implemented. All front-end connections to the back-end must be established so that users can make changes to the database and use the system using client features.
